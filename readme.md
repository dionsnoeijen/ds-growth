# Growth

This is a Blender plugin that simulates branched growth towards particles. This version is still in alpha.

### Things I'm still working on:

- [ ] Make better geometry. (ak, find and fix bugs)
- [ ] Option to close tips. They will grow towards eachother and close.
- [ ] Option to have branches grow stakes in between for a more rigid structure. (3d printing structures)
- [ ] Add a material to the vein clusters.
- [x] Make option to have the vertex without skin.
