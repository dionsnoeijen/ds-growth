# Growth

This is a Blender plugin that simulates branched growth towards particles. This version is still in alpha.

![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dionsnoeijen/ds-growth/master/growth.gif)

### Things I'm still working on:

- [ ] Make better geometry. (ak, find and fix bugs)
- [ ] Option to close tips. They will grow towards eachother and close.
- [ ] Option to have branches grow stakes in between for a more rigid structure. (3d printing structures)
- [ ] Add a material to the vein clusters.
- [ ] Shade smooth
- [ ] Add thickness patterns
- [ ] Documentation.
- [ ] Clean the code.
- [ ] Object origin at cursor.
- [ ] Add proper error handling for when wrong items are selected.
- [ ] Maybe find a way to have it work on moving particles.
- [x] Make option to have the vertex without skin.
